## React Fundamentals Used in This Project

1. **Components** - Reusable UI components were created to ensure a modular structure.
2. **Props** - Data is passed between components as props to customize the UI and manage functionality.
3. **State Management** - State hooks (`useState`) are used to handle dynamic data and UI changes.
4. **Effect Hook** - `useEffect` is used to fetch data from JSON files and run side effects when components are loaded.
5. **React Router** - Routing (`react-router-dom`) is implemented for navigating between pages, enabling multi-page functionality.
6. **Custom Hooks** - Custom hooks were used to manage repeated logic in components.
7. **Helmet** - For dynamic title management on each page.
